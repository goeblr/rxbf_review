# rxbf_review

Implements several beamformers in python for their evaluation.

## Scripts

### toy-examples/ToyExamplePlots.py

Applies the beamformers to toy data - the data from one scatterer and plots the results for visualizing the different aspects of the beamformers.

### comparison/comparison_ustb_data.py

Applies the beamformers to pre-delayed data from the USTB and plots the resulting images and performs contrast ratio (CR), contrast noise ratio (CNR), speckle signal noise ratio (SNRs) and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) measurements.

### toy-examples/ToyExample.py

Playground for the toy data.
